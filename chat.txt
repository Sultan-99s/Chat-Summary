User: Hi AI, I’ve been reading about climate change—can you explain what it is?
AI: Certainly! Climate change refers to long‑term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels.

User: What are the main greenhouse gases?
AI: The primary greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and fluorinated gases. CO₂ from power plants and vehicles is the biggest contributor.

User: How do these gases warm the planet?
AI: They trap heat in the atmosphere by allowing sunlight in but preventing some infrared radiation from escaping back into space—a process known as the greenhouse effect.

User: What evidence do we have that the climate is changing?
AI: Key indicators include rising global average temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events.

User: What impacts are we already seeing?
AI: We see stronger hurricanes, longer droughts, coral bleaching, disrupted ecosystems, and threats to agriculture and freshwater supplies.

User: Are there any projections for the future?
AI: Without emission cuts, temperatures could rise by 2–4 °C by 2100. That would lead to more severe heatwaves, sea‑level rise of up to a meter, and widespread biodiversity loss.

User: What can individuals do to help?
AI: Reduce energy use (LEDs, efficient appliances), drive less, eat a more plant‑based diet, recycle, and support clean‑energy policies.

User: What about at the policy level?
AI: Governments can set carbon pricing (taxes or cap‑and‑trade), invest in renewable energy, enforce emissions standards, and fund climate adaptation projects.

User: How can I stay informed?
AI: Follow reputable sources like the IPCC, NASA’s climate site, and peer‑reviewed journals. Also, engage with local environmental groups.

User: Thanks—that’s really helpful!
AI: You’re welcome! Let me know if you want more details or resources.
